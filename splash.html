  <h1>Welcome Friends,</h1>
    <p>If you've discovered this page in search of great burgers, know you're in good company. This is a place for bacon-laced patties, hunks of bleu cheese, and get-your-hands-juicy burgers. So juicy your hands will be a hot mess, but who the heck cares 'cause it's a burger and that's how it should be. Don't be ashamed friend, you're just doing it right.</p>
    <p>Now, if you're here searching for vegetarian options, you'll find we have those, too. Some of our best friends are herbivores, so we get it: vegetarians like good burgers too.</p>
    <p>We all want to feel good about what we eat, but we want you to feel great about what you're eating. That's why at Local Burger we are committed to providing quality food and beverages from local farmers that care about their product. We've got terrific burgers, sandwiches, salads and sides all made with love, in-house, from locally-sourced ingredients.</p>
    <p>And don't think we've forgotten about you, dear beer lover! In addition to our tasty wine and cocktails, we have 24 tap handles and are all about pouring you that perfect cold one.</p>
    <p>Good burgers, beer, and cocktails, locally sourced from people who care. If you love those things too, then come by and make some burger buddies.</p>
    <p>&mdash;Local Burger</p>
